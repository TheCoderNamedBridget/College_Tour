# College_Tour

This is an app specifically for college students or people visiting college campuses.

It uses an interactive map with search bar and filters to show people where the buildings they want to get to are.

For dorming students it shows what is being served in each of the respective dining halls.

For regular students, it provides an easy way to contact staff through an easy to use staff directory.

For everyone on campus it provides updates for events today, fun facts about the school, and motivational words.
